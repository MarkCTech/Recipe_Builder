# Recipe_Builder  
## Summary
This is a personal project to record the calories and macronutrients from all the food I eat. The program currently asks for an ingredient name then checks if there is a database present, and if the ingredient is within it; It then creates the database or updates an existing one with all other details provided by the user.  
In future updates I will add functionality to calculate calories for a whole recipe, and then collate the information into a timestamped food journal, comparing my intake to my daily requirements.  

 ## Using the program
 Run the .PY in your IDE and it should create a database in a subdirectory named 'database'.
