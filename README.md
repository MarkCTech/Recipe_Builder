# Recipe_Builder  
## Summary
This is a personal project using SQLite to record the calories and macronutrients from all the food I eat. The program asks for a recipe name, then searches for or creates a database, and searches for the recipe within it; If the recipe is not present the user writes it in, using preset or user written ingredients.

The program then calculates the calories and macros for the whole meal, and creates a timestamped log.

 ## Using the program
 Run the .PY in your IDE and it should create a database in a subdirectory named 'database'.
